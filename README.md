## 📝 Introduction

The Student Activity Tracker is a web-based application designed to help students efficiently manage and track their extracurricular or academic activities. This system enables users to register and securely log in to a personal dashboard where they can create, view, edit, and delete their own activities. By integrating basic CRUD operations with secure authentication mechanisms, the system provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to stay organized and reflect on their participation over time. The application aims to support students in developing better self-management habits and maintaining a log of their achievements and involvements.

## 🎯 Objectives

Enable users to register, log in, and log out securely.
Maintain active user sessions to ensure a smooth experience.
# Allow Full Activity Management (CRUD):
Users can create and store new activity entries.
Users can view a list of all their logged activities.
Users can view detailed information for each activity.
Users can update or modify existing activity records.
Users can delete activities they no longer wish to keep.
# Enhance User Experience:
Provide a clean and simple UI to ensure ease of use.
Ensure data is private and only accessible to the respective logged-in user.
# Encourage Self-Tracking:
Promote personal development by allowing students to keep a digital log of their participation in various events or tasks.
